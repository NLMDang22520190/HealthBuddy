# Complete Messaging UI Rebuild - Modern Interface - 2025-01-18

## Problem Description

- When clicking on a conversation to switch from welcome screen to ChatWindow, there's a height/layout issue
- The issue only occurs during the transition from normal screen to chat window
- ChatWindow doesn't fill the full height properly, causing layout problems
- Missing smooth animations and loading states

## Root Cause Analysis

1. MessagesMainBar doesn't follow the same pattern as HomePage and ChatBotMainBar
2. Missing framer-motion animations for smooth transitions
3. No loading states during conversation switching
4. Height management differs from other working components
5. No proper AnimatePresence for component transitions
