- [x] Create RecommendationController with endpoints
- [x] Add recommendation DTOs
- [x] Create UserPreferenceController and Repository
- [x] Update AutoMapper mappings
- [x] Register services in Program.cs

### Phase 2: Recommendation Algorithms

- [x] Content-based filtering for foods
- [x] Content-based filtering for exercises
- [x] Health-condition based filtering
- [x] Allergy and dietary restriction filtering
- [x] BMI-based scoring
- [x] Multi-factor scoring system
- [ ] Collaborative filtering based on user interactions

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- [x] User feedback integration
- [x] Recommendation caching
- [ ] Machine learning scoring system
- [ ] A/B testing framework

### Phase 4: API Endpoints

- [x] GET /api/Recommendation/foods/{userId}
- [x] GET /api/Recommendation/exercises/{userId}
- [x] POST /api/Recommendation/feedback
- [x] GET /api/Recommendation/personalized/{userId}
- [x] GET /api/Recommendation/trending/foods
- [x] GET /api/Recommendation/trending/exercises
- [x] GET /api/UserPreference/{userId}
- [x] POST /api/UserPreference

### Phase 5: Frontend Integration

- [x] RecommendationCard component
